–	A one paragraph description of the overall project

The open source project I am interested in is spring-boot. This project is a framework for web development mostly written in java. 
It is built on top of the spring framework that makes it faster to start a spring project. 
It accomplishes that by removing a lot of the overhead code. For example, you could tell it what 
starters and dependencies you want your project to start out with and start the project with a single command. 
This open source project is widely used in the industry.

–	A short explanation of how the proposal  is linked to the educational goals of this class (slide 7).

The open source project is written in mostly java which is an object-oriented programing. Spring-boot can build the remote procedure 
calls for applications. There are bugs listed on GitHub that I could look for and potentially fix. Spring-boot also includes a couple 
extra education goals, so that’s why I believe it would be a good open source project to work on for class.

–	A one paragraph description of your proposed contribution

I would start by documenting some of the features of spring-boot. Then probably enhance a certain 
part of the code. This will allow me to get more of an understanding of how the framework is coded and works. 
After this I would will have a good understanding of how to fix bugs that have occurred in the program.
